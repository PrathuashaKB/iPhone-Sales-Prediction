# iPhone_Sales_Prediction
Machine Learning model to predict iPhone sales using K-NN algorithm. 

### About :
iPhone sales prediction refers to the process of estimating or forecasting the future sales performance of iPhones. iPhone sales prediction is vital for effective planning, decision-making, and optimization of various aspects of Apple's business operations. It empowers them to align their production, marketing, and supply chain strategies, respond to market dynamics, and stay competitive in the rapidly evolving smartphone industry.

Here is an attempt of iPhone sales prediction using the K-NN algorithm, which classifies or predicts based on the similarity to neighboring data points. It can be applied to sales prediction by finding the most similar historical instances to make forecasts based on their sales outcomes.

### Technologies used :
 1. Machine-Learning algorithm - K-NN(K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm

 2. Python

### Software required :
 1. Kaggle(dataset)

 2. Jupyter Notebook
